Keystone can allow user impersonation when using REMOTE_USER for external
authentication
---

### Summary ###
When external authentication is used with Keystone using the "ExternalDefault"
plug-in, external usernames containing "@" characters are truncated at the "@"
character before being mapped to a local Keystone user. This can result in
separate external users mapping to the same local Keystone user, which could
lead to user impersonation.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Keystone, Havana

### Discussion ###
When Keystone is run in the Apache HTTP Server, the webserver can handle
authentication and pass the authenticated username to Keystone using the
REMOTE_USER environment variable. External authentication behavior is handled
by authentication plugins in Keystone. In the Havana release of OpenStack, if
the external username provided in the REMOTE_USER environment variable
contains an "@" character Keystone will only use the portion preceding the "@"
character as the username when using the "ExternalDefault" authentication
plugin. This results in the ability for multiple unique external usernames to
map to the same single username in Keystone. For example, the external
usernames "jdoe@example1.com" and "jdoe@example2.com" would both map to the
Keystone user "jdoe". This behavior could potentially be abused to allow one to
impersonate another similarly named external user.

Keystone in OpenStack releases prior to Havana uses the entire value contained
in the REMOTE_USER environment variable, so those versions are not vulnerable
to this impersonation issue.

### Recommended Actions ###
If the "ExternalDefault" plugin is being used for external authentication in
the Havana release, you should ensure that external usernames do not contain
"@" characters unless you want to collapse similarly named external users into
a single user on the Keystone side.

If your external usernames do contain "@" characters and you do not want to
collapse similarly named external users into a single user on the Keystone
side, you might be able to use the "ExternalDomain" plug-in. This plugin
considers the portion of the external username that follows an "@" character to
be the domain that the user belongs to in Keystone. This allows similarly named
external users to map to separate Keystone users if the portion of the external
username that follows an "@" character maps to a Keystone domain name. To
configure the "ExternalDomain" authentication plugin, set the "external"
parameter in the "[auth]" section of Keystone's keystone.conf as follows:

---- begin example keystone.conf snippet ----
[auth]
methods = external,password,token
external = keystone.auth.plugins.external.ExternalDomain
---- end example keystone.conf snippet ----

If neither of the above recommendations work for your deployment, a custom
authentication plugin can be created that uses the external username that
contains an "@" character as-is.
