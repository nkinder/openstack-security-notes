Selecting LXC as Nova Virtualization Driver can lead to data compromise
---

### Summary### 
LXC does not provide the same level of separation as hypervisors when chosen as
the Nova 'virtualization driver'. Attempting to use LXC as a drop in
replacement for a hypervisor can result in data exposure between tenants.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Nova, LXC, Libvirt, 'Virtualization Driver'

### Discussion ###
The Libvirt LXC functionality exposed by OpenStack is built on the kernel
namespace & cgroup technologies. Until Linux 3.8, there has been no support for
separate user namespaces in the kernel. As such, there has been no way to
securely isolate containers from each other or the host environment using DAC
(discretionary access control). For example, they can escape their resource
constraints by modifying cgroups settings, or attack the host via various files
in the proc and sysfs filesystems. The use of MAC (mandatory access control)
technologies like SELinux or AppArmour can mitigate these problems, but it is
not practical to write MAC policies that would allow running full OS installs
in LXC under OpenStack.

Although initial user namespace support was merged in Linux 3.8, it is not yet
complete, or mature enough to be considered secure. Work is ongoing to finish
the kernel namespace support and enhance libvirt LXC to take advantage of it.

### Recommended Actions ###
The OSSG advises that anyone deploying Nova in environments that require any
level of separation use a hypervisor such as Xen, KVM, VMware or Hyper-V.

LXC security pivots on a system known as DAC (discretionary access control)
which is not currently capable of providing strong isolation of guests. Work is
underway to improve DAC but itâ€™s not ready for production use at this time.

The OSSG recommends against using LXC for enforcing secure separation of guests.
Even with appropriate AppArmour policies applied.
