Glance allows sharing of images between projects without consumer project
approval
---

### Summary ###
Glance allows images to be shared between projects. In certain API versions,
images can be shared without the consumer project's approval. This allows
potentially malicious images to show up in a project's image list.

### Affected Services / Software ###
Glance, Image Service, Diablo, Essex, Folsom, Grizzly, Havana

### Discussion ###
Since the OpenStack Diablo release, Glance allows images to be shared between
projects. To share an image, the producer of the image adds the consumer
project as a member of the image. When using the Image Service API v1, the
image producer is able to share an image with a consumer project without their
approval. This results in the shared image showing up in the image list for the
consumer project. This can mislead users with roles in the consumer project
into running a potentially malicious image.

The Image Service API v2.0 does not allow image sharing between projects, so a
project is not susceptible to running unauthorized images shared by other
projects. The Image Service API v2.1 allows image sharing using a two-step
process. An image producer must add a consumer as a member of the image, and
the consumer must accept the shared image before it shows up in their image
list. This additional approval process allows a consumer to control what images
show up in their image list, thus preventing potentially malicious images being
used without the consumers knowledge.

### Recommended Actions ###
In the OpenStack Diablo, Essex, and Folsom releases, Glance supports image
sharing using the Image Service API v1. There is no way to require approval of
a shared image by consumer projects. Users should be cautioned to be careful
when using images from their image list, as they may be using an image that was
shared with them without their knowledge.

In the OpenStack Grizzly and Havana releases, Glance supports the Image Service
API v2.1 or later. Support is still provided for Image Service API v1, which
allows image sharing between projects without consumer project approval. It is
recommended to disable v1 of the Image Service API if possible. This can be
done by setting the following directive in the glance-api.conf configuration
file:

---- begin example glance-api.conf snippet ----
enable_v1_api = False
---- end example glance-api.conf snippet ----
